The game rule is simple ,you're controlling a player in 2D topdown dungeon, the goal is to find exit to get into the next level.
you can get game status, player position and exit position.
you can move up/down/left/right. there are walkable waypoints placed in scene, and you can find all waypoint information ,and get nearby waypoints of the player, you can get a nearest waypoint by a given position. for example you can get the closest waypoint to the exit, and know how to get to it by connection of other waypoints.
if you take good use of all waypoint information you can get a path to the exit by a-star pathfinding algrithom easily. or you can try to feel the surrounding world by blindly walk around.
now try to get the exit of the level.

at the begin of the game, you are in MainMenu scene by default, which you could easily find out which scene you are in and the game progress of chapter 1 and 2.
you can load levels less or equal your progress (you can't load unlocked levels).
you can play the game when you are in Gameplay scene.
