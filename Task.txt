this is a unity game for you to play.
the game use http API to get information and sent control input.

test api scripts are placed here, review them as reference.
./test

the data structure is something like in the json of this path
./Agent_Protocols

(the relative path of  root folder is the folder of this task file)

The game rule is simple ,you're controlling a player in 2D topdown dungeon, the goal is to find exit to get into the next level.
you can get game status, player position and exit(target) position.
you can move up/down/left/right. there are walkable waypoints placed in scene, and you can find all waypoint information ,and get nearby waypoints of the player, you can get a nearest waypoint by a given position. for example you can get the closest waypoint to the exit, and know how to get to it by connection of other waypoints.
if you take good use of all waypoint information you can get a path to any position by a-star pathfinding algrithom easily. or you can try to feel the surrounding world by blindly walk around.

at the begin of the game, you are in MainMenu scene by default, which you could easily find out which scene you are in and the game progress of chapter 1 and 2.
you can load levels less or equal your progress (you can't load unlocked levels). for example if your progess in chapter 1 is 9, you can load chapter 1 levels from 1 to 9. after completing level 9, you can proceed to level 10.
you can play the game when you are in Gameplay scene.
once a level is completed, you will be loading a next level in a few seconds.

in chapter 2, levels have a door and a key. door will block your path, a waypoint occupied by door is inaccessible. you need a key to open the door to proceed to level exit.
you can read their positions in gameplay status, try go to pickup the key, and move near the door to send interact command to open door.
once the door is gone, you'll notice that the doorsPositions array will be empty.
then you can keep moving to the exit of the level.

let's see how yon can play.


The following is a summary generated by gemini. use it as reference too
Project OpenClaw: Agent API Specification (Updated)
1. Connection & Core Architecture

Base URL: http://localhost:8091.


Protocol: RESTful HTTP using JSON (UTF-8).

Coordinate System: 2D Top-down (X, Y). Coordinates are flattened (Z is ignored for logic).

Architecture: "Brain-Body" decoupling. Unity handles physics/rendering; the Agent handles logic.

2. Environmental Perception (GET)
Global Status & Progress

Endpoint: /api/status.


Field: sceneName: Identifies if you are in Gameplay or MainMenu.


Field: chapter1Progress / chapter2Progress: Your highest unlocked level index.

Mission, Objects & Inventory

Endpoint: /api/game/task.


Field: keys_positions: Array of coordinates for available keys.

Note: Only active keys are shown. Once picked up, they are removed from this list.


Field: doors_positions: Array of coordinates for locked doors.

Note: Only active doors are shown. Once opened, they are removed from this list.

Field: key_count: (New) Integer representing the number of keys currently held in your inventory.


Field: target_position: The (X, Y) coordinates of the level exit.

Navigation (Waypoints)

Endpoint: /api/waypoints/nearby.


Description: Returns nodes within a 1.5m radius to assist in A* pathfinding.

3. Command & Action Suite (POST)
Movement Control

Endpoint: /api/player/move.


Payload: {"x": float, "y": float}.

Action: Sets the move vector. Clamped between -1.0 and 1.0.

Interaction (Pick Up / Open)
Endpoint: /api/player/interact

Payload: {} (Empty).

Action: (New) Triggers an interaction with the nearest object.

Pick Up: If near a key, adds it to key_count and removes the key from the world.

Open Door: If near a door and key_count > 0, consumes one key and removes the door.

Management Commands

Restart Level: /api/player/restart (Fails in MainMenu).


Load Level: /api/player/level (Requires level to be unlocked).


Main Menu: /api/player/main (Returns to UI).

4. Interaction Workflow for Agents
To successfully navigate the dungeon, the agent should follow this logical loop:


Search: Check keys_positions via /api/game/task.


Navigate: Move toward the nearest key using /api/player/move.

Collect: Call /api/player/interact when overlapping with the key's coordinates.

Verify: Ensure key_count has increased.


Unlock: Navigate to doors_positions and call /api/player/interact to clear the path to the exit.

5. Error Handling

Standard Success: success: true.


COMMAND_FAILED: Occurs if you try to interact without a key or while too far from an object.


PLAYER_NOT_FOUND: Occurs if the agent attempts commands before the level is fully loaded.
